### Salt for password hashes not set
> Salt for password hashes not set! check file `./sirin-scripts/config-core/sirin-private-settings.lua` \
> Salt for second factor shared key not set! check file `./sirin-scripts/config-core/sirin-private-settings.lua`

Both errors are because a password and 2Factor salt has not been set in `/sirin-scripts/config-core/sirin-private-settings.lua`. Edit this file and type in any unique string of characters that will be used when encrypting users passwords.

For best results use a completely random set of characters upto 64 characters

```lua
-- Do not remove these lines
local config = {}
local serverAuth = {}
--------------------------
 
-- Configuration BEGIN
 
config.PasswordSalt = "Rvq2#w9[2/RfbeaS"
config.SecondFactorSalt = "9u0&-9EM[I[=(uZZ"
```

WorldName = RF NOVUS
ServerType = 0
BillingCode = 32
BillOper = 0
FreeServer = 1
HistoryPath = D:\History
```
